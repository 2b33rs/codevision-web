# This file was created to document the approach for handling dependency conflicts
# If you encounter dependency conflicts, consider using one of these approaches:
# 1. Adjust version ranges in package.json (preferred, as done with date-fns)
# 2. Use --legacy-peer-deps flag for npm install if absolutely necessary

# Uncomment the following line only if version adjustments don't resolve conflicts
# legacy-peer-deps=true
